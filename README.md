# GHOSTHACK

**GHOSTHACK** is a cyberpunk-inspired web interface designed to look and feel like a terminal connected to the darknet.  
The site simulates a hacking environment with animated text, encrypted prompts, and a dark aesthetic that immerses the visitor in a futuristic underground network.

## Description

This project is a **static front-end site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It recreates the atmosphere of an underground hacking terminal, complete with:

- A **dark, minimalist design** that enhances the immersive experience.  
- **Terminal-style text output**, mimicking system messages and encryption processes.  
- **Interactive input fields** for name, provider, and API key to give users the sense of logging into a secure system.  
- **Glitch effects and neon highlights** for a retro-futuristic, cyberpunk vibe.  
- **Instant deploy on GitHub Pages**, making it lightweight, fast, and accessible.  

The goal of **GHOSTHACK** is not functional hacking but rather **artistic presentation** â€” a themed interface that captures the look and feel of hacker culture in a safe, creative way.
